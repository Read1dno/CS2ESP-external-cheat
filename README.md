# Erorr
I noticed that when installing "imgui" via pip, the error "ERROR: Failed to build installable wheels for some pyproject.toml based projects (imgui)" may occur due to the fact that you do not have Microsoft C++ Compiler installed. You can download it here - [Microsoft C++ Compiler](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ru/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
